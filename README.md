Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Using Statistical Analysis from Word Pair Extraction

The objective of this project is to pair words from tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hatred if it has a negative sentiment associated with it.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label 'positive' denotes the tweet is favourable, label 'negative' denotes the tweet is adverse and label 'neutral' denotes the tweet is genuine. The objective is to assess Twitter sentiment analysis using various text processing and text representation feature extraction techniques and refine an algorithm that could perform better at word pairing-based Twitter sentiment analysis.
